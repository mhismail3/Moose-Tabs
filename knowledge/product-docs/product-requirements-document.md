## User Stories:

- As a multi-tasking user with many tabs, I want to see my tabs in a collapsible tree structure so that I can easily group and navigate related tabs.
- As a user browsing with multiple windows, I want the tab tree to stay consistent across all open windows on my computer, so I don’t lose track of tab relationships when using more than one window.
- As a power user, I want to open the tab tree in a sidebar that stays visible while I browse, so I can manage tabs without constantly switching views.
- As an organized user, I want to collapse or expand groups of tabs (branches) to reduce clutter and focus on what’s relevant.
- As an international user, I want the extension available in my language, so I can use it comfortably (support for i18n).

## Core Features & Priorities:

- Tree-Style Tab View (P0 – High): Tabs opened from another tab appear as indented child nodes, showing parent-child relationships. Users can expand/collapse tab branches. This is the core functionality for visual tab hierarchy.
- Persistent Sidebar UI (P0 – High): Integrate with Chrome’s Side Panel API to provide a sidebar that remains open during browsing. Users can pin this tree view for always-on access.
- Multi-Window Sync (P1 – High): Maintain tab hierarchy across all open windows on the same machine. Actions in one window’s tree reflect in others in real time (a common pain point in existing solutions).
- Tab Management Actions (P1 – Medium): Drag-and-drop tabs within the tree to reorder or change parent. Also include keyboard shortcuts (e.g. to create a new child tab, move tabs) for power users.
- Modern Retro-Futuristic UI (P2 – Medium): Clean, minimal interface with a slightly retro-futuristic design aesthetic (e.g. subtle neon accents, retro fonts) to differentiate visually. Light and dark themes included.
- Search and Filter (P2 – Low): Quick search box to filter tabs by title/URL, helping users jump to a tab among dozens.
- Chrome Integration (P2 – Low): Basic support for Chrome tab groups and pinned tabs (e.g. indicate groups, allow collapsing by group, show pinned tabs at top).

## Success Metrics:

- Adoption: X installs and Y daily active users within 3 months of launch. Positive user feedback (Chrome Web Store rating ≥ 4.5).
- Efficiency: Users report improved tab navigation efficiency (e.g. 30% reduction in time to find a tab or organize tabs).
- Performance: Handles 100+ open tabs per window with minimal lag (<100ms UI update on tab events).
Memory footprint and CPU usage remain low (no significant slow-down of Chrome).
- Retention: >50% of users still use the extension after 4 weeks (indicating it’s truly helpful for tab management).
- Stability: No crashes or major UI glitches during continuous usage; fast sync of tab changes between windows (<1s).

## Technical Constraints:

- Chrome-Only, Manifest V3: Must use Chrome extension Manifest V3 and APIs (Chrome 114+ for Side Panel). Not intended for other browsers.
- Chrome Tabs API: Use chrome.tabs and chrome.windows APIs to track tabs. Chrome doesn’t
inherently maintain tree structure, so extension must manage hierarchy (using tab openerTabId for initial parent-child links).
- Local Sync Only: Use local storage or background script to sync state across windows. Do not use cloud storage (no cross-device sync) to avoid complexity and privacy issues.
- Performance/Size: Keep the extension lightweight – use a modern framework (React) but minimize bundle size. Avoid heavy libraries or memory-leaking patterns, since it runs continuously.
- Internationalization: All user-facing text must be externalized using Chrome i18n ( _locales messages). Ensure the UI accommodates different text lengths for various languages.
- Security & Privacy: Limit permissions to only those needed (e.g. tabs, sidePanel, storage). No browsing data is sent to external servers. Adhere to Chrome Web Store policies for user data.
