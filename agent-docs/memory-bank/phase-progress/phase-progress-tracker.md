## Post-Release Issues and Fixes

### Issue: "No tabs available" despite existing tabs
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Description:** Users reported that the sidebar frequently shows "No tabs available" even when browser tabs exist, particularly after extension startup or service worker suspension.

**Root Cause:** Chrome service workers can be suspended and restarted, causing the TabTree hierarchy to be lost without proper re-initialization.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Enhanced Background Script Initialization:** Added proactive hierarchy checking in message handlers
- **Service Worker Wakeup Detection:** Added initialization code that runs when service worker loads/reloads
- **Automatic Re-initialization:** Background script now detects empty hierarchy and automatically re-initializes from existing browser tabs
- **Improved Error Handling:** Added refresh button in UI when no tabs are available
- **Tab Count Validation:** Compares hierarchy tab count with actual browser tab count to detect desync

**Files Modified:**
- `public/background.js` - Added `ensureHierarchyInitialized()`, `countTabsInHierarchy()`, service worker wakeup handling
- `src/App.js` - Added "No tabs available" state with refresh button
- `public/_locales/en/messages.json` and `public/_locales/es/messages.json` - Added "refresh_button" localization
- `tests/no-tabs-issue-fix.test.js` - 6 new tests covering the fix

**Test Coverage:** 6 new tests (177 total passing)
