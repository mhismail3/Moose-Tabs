# Moose-Tabs: Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Moose-Tabs Chrome extension, emphasizing a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## 1. Testing Pyramid

We will follow the principles of the testing pyramid:

-   **Unit Tests (Lots):** The base of the pyramid. These will test individual functions, classes, and React components in isolation.
-   **Integration Tests (Some):** These will test the interaction between different parts of the extension, for example, between the background script and the sidebar UI.
-   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Few):** These will test the entire application flow from a user's perspective, running in a real browser environment.

## 2. Tools and Frameworks

-   **Unit & Component Testing:** [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for testing React components.
-   **Integration & E2E Testing:** A browser automation framework like [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) or [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) combined with a test runner like Jest to control a Chrome instance with the extension loaded.
-   **Mocking:** Jest's built-in mocking capabilities will be used to mock Chrome APIs for unit tests. For integration tests, we can use libraries like `sinon-chrome`.

## 3. Test Plan by Phase

### Phase 1: Core Extension Setup & Background Logic
-   **Unit Tests:**
    -   `TabTree` class: Test methods for adding, removing, moving nodes, and finding parents/children.
-   **Integration Tests:**
    -   Background script: Test that `chrome.tabs` events correctly trigger updates to the `TabTree` instance.

### Phase 2: Sidebar UI with React
-   **Unit/Component Tests:**
    -   `TabTreeComponent`: Test that it renders the tab hierarchy correctly based on props.
    -   `TabItem` component: Test that it displays tab information correctly and handles user interactions (like clicks).
-   **Integration Tests:**
    -   Test the communication between the sidebar UI and the background script. Ensure that UI updates when the background `TabTree` changes.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
-   **Unit/Component Tests:**
    -   Test the state logic for collapsing/expanding branches in `TabItem`.
    -   Test the drag-and-drop handler functions.
-   **E2E Tests:**
    -   Test multi-window sync by automating two browser windows.
    -   Test drag-and-drop functionality in a real browser environment.

### Phase 4: Polish and Finalization
-   **Unit/Component Tests:**
    -   Test the theme switching logic.
    -   Test that components render the correct text for different locales.
-   **E2E Tests:**
    -   Test keyboard navigation for accessibility.
    -   Visually inspect the UI for correct theming and i18n implementation.

## 4. Continuous Integration

All tests will be run automatically on every push to the repository using a CI/CD service like GitHub Actions. This will ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.
