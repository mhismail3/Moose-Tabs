/**
 * Test Summary: Drag-and-Drop Bounce Animation Fix
 * 
 * ISSUE FIXED:
 * When dragging tabs and switching between drop targets, tabs below would 
 * "bounce" down and back up due to layout-affecting CSS properties being
 * applied/removed during drag operations.
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE:
 * Three CSS classes were using layout-affecting properties (padding/margin):
 * 1. .tab-item.drop-zone-active had padding-bottom: 30px
 * 2. .tab-item.drop-zone-invalid had padding-bottom: 30px  
 * 3. .tab-content.drop-target had padding: 15px 0; margin: 15px;
 * 
 * SOLUTION:
 * Removed all layout-affecting properties and used transform-only positioning
 * for visual feedback, plus reduced debounce delay to minimize timing conflicts.
